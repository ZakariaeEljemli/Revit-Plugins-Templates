# Ribbon Panels and Controls
Revit provides API solutions to integrate custom ribbon panels and controls. These APIs are used with IExternalApplication. 
Custom ribbon panels can be added to the Add-Ins tab, the Analyze tab or to a new custom ribbon tab.
Panels can include buttons, both large and small, which can be either simple push buttons, pulldown buttons containing multiple commands, 
or split buttons which are pulldown buttons with a default push button attached. 
In addition to buttons, panels can include radio groups, combo boxes and text boxes. Panels can also include vertical 
separators to help separate commands into logical groups. 
Finally, panels can include a slide out control accessed by clicking on the bottom of the panel.
<h2 align="center">Create a New Ribbon Tab</h2>
Although ribbon panels can be added to the Add-Ins or Analyze tab, they can also be added to a new custom ribbon tab. This option should only be used if necessary. To ensure that the standard Revit ribbon tabs remain visible, a limit of 20 custom ribbon tabs is imposed.
The following image shows a new ribbon tab with one ribbon panel and a few simple controls.
